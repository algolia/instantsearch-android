InstantSearch family: **InstantSearch Android** | [InstantSearch iOS][instantsearch-ios-github] | [React InstantSearch][react-instantsearch-github] | [InstantSearch.js][instantsearch-js-github] | [Angular InstantSearch][instantsearch-angular-github] | [Vue InstantSearch][instantsearch-vue-github].

**InstantSearch Android** is a library providing widgets and helpers to help you build the best instant-search experience on Android with Algolia.
It is built on top of Algolia's [Kotlin API Client][kotlin-client] to provide you a high-level solution to quickly build various search interfaces.

# Examples

You can see InstantSearch Android in action in our [examples app][examples-url], have a look at it to see concrete examples of all the available widgets.

# Usage

You can add InstantSearch to your Android application by adding the following line to your `build.gradle`'s dependencies.
```groovy
implementation "com.algolia:instantsearch-android:$instantsearch_version"
// or, for Compose UI
implementation "com.algolia:instantsearch-compose:$instantsearch_version"
```
<!--TODO Document using com.algolia.instantsearch.helper.helper-jvm / using core directly -->

⚠️ Important: starting from version `2.4.0`, the library is compatible only with kotlin version `1.3.70` or higher; for previous versions of kotlin, please use version `2.3.1` of the library.  
ℹ️ Please follow the [migration guide](docs/guide/Migration_2.5.x_2.6.x.md) to migrate from `2.5.x` or below to the latest version.

See the [documentation][doc]. You can start with the [Getting Started Guide][getting-started].

### Insights

You can add **InstantSearch Insights** to your Android application by adding the following line to your `build.gradle`'s dependencies.
```groovy
implementation "com.algolia:instantsearch-insights-android:$instantsearch_version"
```

Please refer to the [library](instantsearch-insights/README.md) for more details.

### R8 / Proguard rules

If you use this library in an Android project which uses R8, there is nothing you have to do. The specific rules are 
already bundled into the JAR, which can be interpreted by R8 automatically.

If however, you don’t use R8, then you might need rules from [Algolia Kotlin Client](https://github.com/algolia/algoliasearch-client-kotlin#r8--proguard-rules) which is a dependency of this library.

## Telemetry
InstantSearch Android collects data points at runtime. This helps the InstantSearch team improve and prioritize future development.

Here's an exhaustive list of the collected data:

- InstantSearch version
- The name of the instantiated InstantSearch components, for example, `HitsSearcher`, `FilterState`
- The name of the components with custom parameters (overridden defaults). InstantSearch doesn't collect the values of those parameters. For example, the default of the `facets` value in `FacetListInteractor` is an empty list. If you instantiate it with a list of facets, then the telemetry tracks that the `facets` parameter received a custom value, but not the value itself.

InstantSearch doesn't collect any sensitive or personal data. However, you can still opt out of the telemetry collection with the following code:
```kotlin
Telemetry.shared.enabled = false
```
