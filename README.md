## Requirements

* Kotlin 1.6+
* Android SDK 21+
* Java 8+

### R8 / Proguard rules

If you use this library in an Android project which uses R8, there is nothing you have to do. The specific rules are 
already bundled into the JAR, which can be interpreted by R8 automatically.

If however, you don’t use R8, then you might need rules from [Algolia Kotlin Client](https://github.com/algolia/algoliasearch-client-kotlin#r8--proguard-rules) which is a dependency of this library.

## Telemetry
InstantSearch Android collects data points at runtime. This helps the InstantSearch team improve and prioritize future development.

Here's an exhaustive list of the collected data:

- InstantSearch version
- The name of the instantiated InstantSearch components, for example, `HitsSearcher`, `FilterState`
- The name of the components with custom parameters (overridden defaults). InstantSearch doesn't collect the values of those parameters. For example, the default of the `facets` value in `FacetListInteractor` is an empty list. If you instantiate it with a list of facets, then the telemetry tracks that the `facets` parameter received a custom value, but not the value itself.

InstantSearch doesn't collect any sensitive or personal data. However, you can still opt out of the telemetry collection with the following code:
```kotlin
Telemetry.shared.enabled = false
```
