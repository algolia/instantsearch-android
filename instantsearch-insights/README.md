# InstantSearch Insights for Android

**InstantSearch Insights Android** library allows developers to report click and conversion metrics related to search
queries. It does so by correlating events with queryIDs generated by the search API when a query
parameter `clickAnalytics=true` is set.

# Getting started

**InstantSearch Insights** is supported on Android devices starting from SDK 21 and it is built on top of
Algolia's [Kotlin API Client][kotlin-client] .

# Install

You can add **InstantSearch Insights** to your Android application by adding the following line to your `build.gradle`'s
dependencies.

```groovy
implementation "com.algolia:instantsearch-insights-android:$instantsearch_version"
```

## Quick Start

### Initialize the Insights client

You first need to initialize the **Insights client**. For that you need your **Application ID**, **API Key** and the **
index name**. You can find them on [your Algolia account](https://www.algolia.com/api-keys).

```kotlin
val appID = ApplicationID("applicationID")
val apiKey = APIKey("apiKey")
val indexName = IndexName("indexName")
val configuration = Insights.Configuration(
    connectTimeoutInMilliseconds = 5000,
    readTimeoutInMilliseconds = 5000
)
registerInsights(context, appID, apiKey, indexName, configuration)
```

### Sending metrics

Once that you registered your **index** with the **Application ID** and the **API Key** you can easily start sending
metrics

#### View events

**Hits**
```kotlin
val hitsTracker = HitsTracker(
    eventName = EventName("hits"),
    searcher = searcher,
    insights = sharedInsights(indexName)
)

hitsTracker.trackView(hit)
```

**Filters**
```kotlin
val filterTracker = FilterTracker(
    eventName = EventName("demo"),
    searcher = searcher,
    insights = sharedInsights(IndexName)
)

filterTracker.trackView(facet)
```

#### Click events

**Hits**
```kotlin
val hitsTracker = HitsTracker(
    eventName = EventName("hits"),
    searcher = searcher,
    insights = sharedInsights(indexName)
)

hitsTracker.trackClick(hit, position)
```

**Filters**
```kotlin
val filterTracker = FilterTracker(
    eventName = EventName("demo"),
    searcher = searcher,
    insights = sharedInsights(IndexName)
)

filterTracker.trackClick(facet)
```

#### Conversion events

**Kotlin**

```kotlin
Insights.shared?.converted("eventName", EventObjects.IDs("objectID1", "objectID2"))
Insights.shared?.converted("eventName", EventObjects.Filters("foo:bar", "foo:baz"))
Insights.shared?.convertedAfterSearch("eventName", "queryID", EventObjects.IDs("objectID1", "objectID2"))
```

**Java**

```java
Insights.shared().converted("eventName",new EventObjects.IDs("objectID1","objectID2"));
    Insights.shared().converted("eventName",new EventObjects.Filters("foo:bar","foo:baz"));
    Insights.shared().convertedAfterSearch("eventName","queryID",new EventObjects.IDs("objectID1","objectID2"));
```

### Event Batching

By default, events are only sent by batches of 10. You can customize this setting with `minBatchSize`:

**Kotlin**

```kotlin
Insights.shared?.minBatchSize = 1 // Sends each event as soon as it is tracked
```

**Java**

```java
Insights.shared().setMinBatchSize(1); // Sends each event as soon as it is tracked
```

### User tracking

Any event should have an `userToken` field to specify the user it relates to. You can set it in three ways:

- Globally for all events
- Per application, for every event tracked by this app
- Individually on an event

**Kotlin**

```kotlin
// Global userToken default value
val configuration = Insights.Configuration(
    connectTimeoutInMilliseconds = 5000,
    readTimeoutInMilliseconds = 5000,
    defaultUserToken = "foo"
)
Insights.register("testApp", "testKey", "indexName", configuration)

// Application userToken, overrides global default
Insights.shared?.userToken = "bar"

// Event usertoken, overrides previous defaults
Insights.shared?.clicked(
    Event.Click(
        "eventName",
        "userToken",
        System.currentTimeMillis(),
        "queryId",
        Arrays.asList("objectID1", "objectID2")
    )
)
```

**Java**

```java
// Global userToken default value
Insights.Configuration configuration=new Insights.Configuration(5000,5000,"foo");
    Insights.register(context,"testApp","testKey","indexName",configuration);

// Application userToken, overrides global default
    Insights.shared().setUserToken("bar");

// Event userToken, overrides previous defaults
    Insights.shared().clicked(new Event.Click("eventName","userToken",System.currentTimeMillis(),"queryId",Arrays.asList("objectID1","objectID2")));
```

### User opt-out

You should allow users to opt-out of tracking anytime they want to. When they request opt-out, you can honor it
using `enabled`:

**Kotlin**

```kotlin
Insights.shared?.enabled = false
```

**Java**

```java
Insights.shared().setEnabled(false);
```

### Logging and debuging

In case you want to check if the metric was sent correctly, you need to enable the logging first

```kotlin
Insights.shared?.loggingEnabled = true
```

```java
Insights.shared().setLoggingEnabled(true)
```

After you enabled it, you can check the output for success messages or errors

```
// Success
D/Algolia Insights - indexName Sync succeeded for Click(params: {"position": 2, "queryID": 74e382ecaf889f9f2a3df0d4a9742dfb,"objectID": 85725102})

// Error
D/Algolia Insights - indexName The objectID field is missing (Code: 422)
```

## Upload mechanism

Events are stored in a `SharedPreference` database. Each time an event is successfuly uploaded, it is removed from the
database. An event can be updated using two distinct mechanisms:

### Single upload attempt

Every time a new event is stored in the database, the following check is performed:

If the number of events is superior or equal to `minBatchSize`, an attempt at uploading all events is performed. If the
attempt fails, because of a network issue for example, it will not be retried, and events remain stored in the database.
If you set `minBatchSize` to `1`, an upload attempt will be performed each time a new event is generated.

### Periodic upload

The Insights library relies on a third party library [android-job](https://github.com/evernote/android-job/). Every 15
minutes, a job will run in the background, whether the application is launched in the foreground or not. Each time a job
runs, it will attempt to upload all events stored in the database. If it fails, because of a network issue for example,
it will be retried later. The 15 minutes delay between each attempt is enforced by the Android system. It does not allow
for a shorter delay, for battery saving reason. You can however configure a longer delay, by setting an higher value
than `15` to the variable `debouncingIntervalInMinutes`. Any value below 15 will be ignored, and the 15 minutes delay
will remain.
